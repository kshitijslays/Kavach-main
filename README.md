## 🌟 Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

Kavach moves beyond **reactive alert** systems to deliver a proactive, verified safety system.

1.  **Tamper-Proof Digital Trust:** Our core feature is the **Blockchain-Anchored Digital ID**. We use Smart Contracts to lock an immutable cryptographic hash of the tourist's KYC data, guaranteeing the identity is **100% genuine** and untampered.

2.  **Zero-Paperwork Efficiency:** We replace manual documentation with a single Digital ID, enabling **Zero-Paperwork Onboarding** and fast, **Automated E-FIR Generation** upon incident detection, drastically cutting emergency response time.

3.  **Proactive Safety Intelligence:** We use **AI to predict distress** based on live GPS tracking and behavioral anomalies, coupled with **Geo-Fencing** to alert users *before* they enter high-risk zones, allowing for pre-emptive intervention.

How safety route is calculated ?

Kavach calculates route safety with combined signals:
Street lighting (well-lit → best)
Business density (more businesses → safer)
Population density (more people → safer)

Route data flow
Get origin + destination coordinates (source text geocoding)
Fetch route alternatives from OpenRouteService (driving-car)
Compute route bounds (buffer around origin+destination)
Fetch OSM lighting data in bounds
Fetch OSM business/population proxies in bounds
For each route:
decode polyline into points
apply lighting classification per point
compute density scores near points
combine into final safety score
Sort routes by final score, show top 2

Function: scoreBusinessDensity(points, businessData)

For each route point:
count nearby business points within 70m (shops/restaurants/banks/etc)
Score = (matchedPoints / totalPoints) * 100
0 = none, 100 = all points near business


. Population density score
Function: scorePopulationDensity(points, populationData)

Route points close to residential/urban way segments
Score = (matchedPoints / totalPoints) * 100

6. Composite safety score
Function: combineScores(lighting, business, population)

Weights used:

lighting: 55%
business: 30%
population: 15%
