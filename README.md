## üåü Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

Kavach moves beyond **reactive alert** systems to deliver a proactive, verified safety system.

1.  **Tamper-Proof Digital Trust:** Our core feature is the **Blockchain-Anchored Digital ID**. We use Smart Contracts to lock an immutable cryptographic hash of the tourist's KYC data, guaranteeing the identity is **100% genuine** and untampered.

2.  **Zero-Paperwork Efficiency:** We replace manual documentation with a single Digital ID, enabling **Zero-Paperwork Onboarding** and fast, **Automated E-FIR Generation** upon incident detection, drastically cutting emergency response time.

3.  **Proactive Safety Intelligence:** We use **AI to predict distress** based on live GPS tracking and behavioral anomalies, coupled with **Geo-Fencing** to alert users *before* they enter high-risk zones, allowing for pre-emptive intervention.
